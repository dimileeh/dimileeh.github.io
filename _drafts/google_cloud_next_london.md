On 3-4 May 2017, Google hosted its largest event in the UK - Google Cloud Next London. The event took place at ExCel and gathered around 4,500 developers, IT professionals, entrepreneurs, executives and analysts. An opening video invited participants to imagine the future that we all can create by harnessing the power of the Cloud and intelligent business models fuelled by the plethora of data that companies have been generating. Diane Greene - Senior Vice President - promptly reassured everyone that the data stored in the Cloud remains the property of the companies and that Google doesn't use it for its own purposes.

The two-day agenda was packed with concurrently running 45-minute sessions covering the latest available Cloud technologies and announcing the ones to be released in the nearest future. To me, the topics covering machine learning and artificial intelligence were of interest but I also attended a few sessions on containers and serverless computing.
