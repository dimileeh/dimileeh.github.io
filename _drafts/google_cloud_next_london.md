On 3-4 May 2017, Google hosted its largest event in the UK - Google Cloud Next London. The event took place at ExCel and gathered around 4,500 developers, IT professionals, entrepreneurs, executives and analysts. An opening video invited participants to imagine the future that we all can create by harnessing the power of the Cloud and intelligent business models fuelled by the plethora of data that companies have been generating. Diane Greene - Senior Vice President - promptly reassured everyone that the data stored in the Cloud remains the property of the companies and that Google doesn't use it for its own purposes.

Probably as a way to demonstrate the the Cloud is not only a way to save on infrastructure costs and get started quickly for 21st-centuric start-ups but also a means to survive and compete for established companies with long history, HSBC - a global bank - were invited as the first guest speakers. HSBC CTO shared the bank's route from good old-fashioned relational databases, traditional data warehousing, then onto an ecosystem built with Hadoop and Spark. The latter proved that the abundance of data in itself  is difficult to manage, and this is where Google Cloud with its machine learning models can make the difference.

Following that, Google showed a demo of their Data Loss Prevention API, which is still in beta. Personally Identifiable Information is a concern not only for the banks but also for all internet industry in highly-regulated Europe. The service detects sensitive information like credit card numbers, names, passport details and masks it automatically. Moreover, it was demonstrated to be intelligent enough to distinguish a valid credit card number from a fake one by verifying the checksum. "In the era when credit card details are sold on the black market with a 100% money-back guarantee" such service will definitely become handy for companies that care about their reputation.

Tech companies are not the only ones that can benefit from the Cloud. LUSH - a cosmetic manufacturer presented by shops around the globe - brought a delightful scent spread by a selection of their hand-made perfume to the floor with Google Partner stands. At the stage, LUSH CTO talked about how easily and quickly they managed to move their full IT infrastructure to the Cloud.

The two-day agenda was packed with concurrently running 45-minute sessions covering the latest available Cloud technologies and announcing the ones to be released in the nearest future. To me, the topics covering machine learning and artificial intelligence were of interest but I also attended a few sessions on containers and serverless computing.
