In this post, I'd like to share my experience of getting into a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence through the [Machine Learning and Data Analysis Specialization][mlda-link] created by my alma mater - Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) - and Yandex on Coursera.

I started the specialization in April 2016 and finished in December 2016. With a full-time job and warm summer days, I missed a couple of deadlines and graduated in 8 months. Nevertheless, I'm quite proud of this achievement, especially because it felt a bit like getting back to my life as a student of one of [the best universities in the world][mipt-best].

The specialization is split in six courses as follows:
1. [Maths and Python for Data Analysis](#1-maths-and-python-for-data-analysis)
2. [Supervised Machine Learning](#2-supervised-machine-learning)
3. [Unsupervised Machine Learning](#3-unsupervised-machine-learning)
4. [Statistics for Data Analysis](#4-statistics-for-data-analysis)
5. [Applied Problems of Data Analysis](#5-applied-problems-of-data-analysis)
6. [Capstone Project](#6-capstone-project)

### 1. Maths and Python for Data Analysis
Since I didn't have a chance to work with Python before, I found this introductry course very useful to get acquainted with the Python syntax, data structures and its powerful libraries for data analysis like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, etc.

### 2. Supervised Machine Learning

### 3. Unsupervised Machine Learning

### 4. Statistics for Data Analysis

### 5. Applied Problems of Data Analysis

### 6. Capstone Project
