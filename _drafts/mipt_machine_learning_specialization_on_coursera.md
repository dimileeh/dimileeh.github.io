In this post, I'd like to share my experience of getting into a fascinating field of Artificial Intelligence through the [Machine Learning and Data Analysis Specialization][mlda-link] created by my alma mater - Moscow Institute of Physics and Technology (MIPT) - and Yandex on Coursera.

I started the specialization in April 2016 and finished in December 2016. With a full-time job and warm summer days, I missed a couple of deadlines and graduated in 8 months. Nevertheless, I'm quite proud of this achievement, especially because it felt a bit like getting back to my life as a student of one of [the best universities in the world][mipt-best].

What I found exceptional about this particular specialization is the fact that almost all lessons were accompanied with a nicely formatted PDF containing lecture notes. Comparing it with a couple of Nanodegrees on Udacity that I'm in progress of pursuing, I can say that it's probably one of the very few programs created with such fantastic diligence and attention to details. I learn by reading, so these assets were of great value to me, and I keep referring back to them from time to time.

The specialization is split into six courses as follows:
1. [Maths and Python for Data Analysis](#1-maths-and-python-for-data-analysis)
2. [Supervised Machine Learning](#2-supervised-machine-learning)
3. [Unsupervised Machine Learning](#3-unsupervised-machine-learning)
4. [Statistics for Data Analysis](#4-statistics-for-data-analysis)
5. [Applied Problems of Data Analysis](#5-applied-problems-of-data-analysis)
6. [Capstone Project](#6-capstone-project)

### 1. Maths and Python for Data Analysis
Since I didn't have a chance to work with Python before, I found this introductory course very useful to get acquainted with the Python syntax, data structures and its powerful libraries for data analysis like `numpy`, `pandas`, `scipy`, `sklearn`, `seaborn`, etc. I found the fact of mentioning the ["The Zen of Python"](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) quite adorable. It's always good to learn how it all started and get to know the philosophy behind the language. From the very beginning, all programming was done in Jupyter Notebooks, which is now geting so popular in the Data Science community.

Revising Maths - Statistics, Linear Algebra, and Calculus - that I studied over 7 years ago brought up fond memories. In the spirit of education at MIPT, the authors of the specialization decided to provide all Maths relevant to machine learning in the beginning rather than explain it the context of applied problems along the programme. Thus, the course introduces multivariable calculus, optimization problems (gradient descent, simulated annealing, differential evolution, Neldear-Mead method), singular value decomposition (SVD), statistical distributions and confidence intervals. The majority of the students, including myself, I guess, will hardly remember the maths details behind the `scipy` functions. In the end, who programs genetic algorithms on a regular basis? Still, I reckon it was a good decision to capture all Maths in one place because the foundation matters.
