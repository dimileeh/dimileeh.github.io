![Dmitri Lihhatsov](/images/me.png "Dmitri Lihhatsov")

My name is Dmitri Lihhatsov, I'm an entrepreneur and a consultant. I started this blog to establish my personal brand, share my findings and experiences. By exploring ideas from disciplines ranging from artificial intelligence and natural science to psychology and economics, I aim at finding interconnections between them because, quoting a biologist Julian Huxley, "Life is just one damn relatedness after another".

Occasionally, I make a deep dive into a particular discipline. As of 2016, I have been studying machine learning - a fascinating field of science that is based on mathematics from the 18-20th centuries while benefiting from advances in computing and the ever increasing amount of available data. We are at the dawn of a new technological revolution that will bring human-machine collaboration to the next level, and I am inspired by opportunities to make people's lives more enriching and fulfilling.

I am also interested in self-development and personal productivity. Having been influenced at first by Stephen Covey's "7 Habits of Highly Effective People", I got into the world of self-help literature and biographies. Two living people with whom I am impressed the most are Elon Musk, the founder of such companies as Tesla and SpaceX, and Charlie Munger, a businessman and investor, Warren Buffet's life-long partner.
